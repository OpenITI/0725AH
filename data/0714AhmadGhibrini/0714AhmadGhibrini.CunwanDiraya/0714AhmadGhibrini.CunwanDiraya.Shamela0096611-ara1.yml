90#VERS#COMMENT##: Very good digital edition conforming very closely to
    the printed edition. The following HTML line runs throughout: <div
    dir="rtl" id="book-container">, as well as some others.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)

    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Untagged headers tagged. 2. Pages 163-173 is an
    index of Ibn Arabiâ€™s writings produced by himself (see page 159) and should be
    split off. I raised an issue for this.
