90#VERS#COMMENT##: The digital text is based upon the 1st edition, but I have collated to the second edition because the first edition could not be found online. The pagination roughly conforms to the printed edition, although not in terms of numbering which is totally different. Otherwise, the text is close to the printed edition. The text, however, is not usefully divided. The titles are not discriptive (rather a basmala). There are many biographical entries but these are not labelled seperately. It would thus need a specialist to mark the various biographical entries.
