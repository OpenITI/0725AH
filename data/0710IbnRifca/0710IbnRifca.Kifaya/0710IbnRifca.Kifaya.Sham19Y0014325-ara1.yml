90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text was pretagged by Peter's conversion, which has worked
    perfectly due to the text's very systematic structure. I did not have to correct
    any of the headers. Pagination also appears to be fine. I changed the , commas
    to ، which looks better. Sometimes the text seems to skip pages, but this is
    because of extensive footnotes taking up all the space in the edition. In a few
    cases these empty pages were replaced by strings of "000", which I have deleted.
    I have tagged the relatively few verses of poetry in the text, though I may have
    missed some as this was not consistently formatted in the text, so I had to do
    various searches for phrases typically introducing poetry or mentions of the
    meter.
    The edition contains an extra volume (volume 20) with a hashiya by IbnRifca's
    student al-Isnawi. This has not been digitised, but may be worthwhile to
    digitise as a separate text.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 243, 3466,
    66717, 69558, 75523
