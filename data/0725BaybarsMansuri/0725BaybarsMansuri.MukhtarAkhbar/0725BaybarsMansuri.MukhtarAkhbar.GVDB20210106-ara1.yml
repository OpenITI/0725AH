90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digitised via Google OCR, cleaned up and annotated by
        Gowaart using simplified mARkdown. Poetry has been tagged. The edition
        in fact only includes the final part of the unique manuscript preserving
        this text (skipping anything pre-Ayyubid), so this is an incomplete text
        -- the first page of the MS included in the edition shows that the text
        in fact starts in pre-Islamic times. Page 6 is missing from pdf so has
        not been digitised. On pp. 88-90 information is in a sort of tabulated
        form, I have used pipes to separate the items.
       NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes. Page 6 is available in the PDF. So, I added MISSING_PARTS label.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
