90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digitised via Google OCR, cleaned up and annotated by
    Gowaart using simplified mARkdown. Poetry has been tagged. The edition
    in fact only includes the final part of the unique manuscript preserving
    this text (skipping anything pre-Ayyubid), so this is an incomplete text
    -- the first page of the MS included in the edition shows that the text
    in fact starts in pre-Islamic times. Page 6 is missing from pdf so has
    not been digitised. On pp. 88-90 information is in a sort of tabulated
    form, I have used pipes to separate the items.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes. Page 6 is available in the PDF. So, I
    added MISSING_PARTS label.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)

    Update 2023: Gowaart merged the edition with the part of the manuscript that was
    not included in the published edition (Milan Ambrosiana Library Ambrosiana
    C45inf) via eScriptorium, the edition via Google OCR. The text was cleaned up
    and annotated by Gowaart. Page 6 which was missing in the previous version was
    also digitised when assembling the text.
