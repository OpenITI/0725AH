90#VERS#COMMENT##: In the metadata the publisher 'Dar al-Qalam al-'Arabi' is wrongly detailed as located in Beirut. It is in Aleppo according to Worldcat and elsewhere online. However, I could not find this edition online. It has been collated with an edition which includes largely the same titles, but not pagination. For the majority of the work the text is the same. Occasionally titles vary. There are 2 missing sections: one of about half a page, and another of 2 1/2 pages of the printed edition. The first is from line 1504; missing part approx. pg. 53-4 of the pdf. The second is from line 2216; missing part approx. pg. 83-5 of PDF.
