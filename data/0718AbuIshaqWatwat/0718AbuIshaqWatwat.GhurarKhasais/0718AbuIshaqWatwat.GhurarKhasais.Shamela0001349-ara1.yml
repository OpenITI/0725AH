90#VERS#COMMENT##: Paragraph markers are not consistent in the text. I
    have corrected a few in the introduction, but it would take too much
    time to apply it throughout the text. Some mistagging in the
    introduction's table of contents which I have also reformatted. I've
    rendered every (sub)header onto one line. Poetry has been automatically
    tagged, except incomplete bayts which only have the first hemistich,
    these are generally buried in paragraphs. I have only corrected them
    where I could spot them easily. The Arabic text seems to be of quite
    high quality but does have typos (for example second word on line 5366
    should be su'ila not mathala).
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 2964, 3006
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 590, 5377, 6912,
    8006
