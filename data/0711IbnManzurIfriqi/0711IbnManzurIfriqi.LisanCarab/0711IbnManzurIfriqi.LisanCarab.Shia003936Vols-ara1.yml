90#VERS#COMMENT##: There is no publishing information in the shia file,
    however, it is clearly based on the 1st edition published by Dar al-
    Sadir. I choose this version over the shamela because, in spite of it
    having no tags, it has preserved the subsections from the printed
    edition which divide each letter entry. For example, 'fasl al-hamza,
    fasl al-ba' al-muwahhada', etc. For some reason, these are omitted from
    the other versions. It would be useful for the reader to have these
    subdivision to be able to find roots easier. UPDATE: Only partially
    tagged: this version was abandoned as the subsections are not
    necessarily needed at this stage.
