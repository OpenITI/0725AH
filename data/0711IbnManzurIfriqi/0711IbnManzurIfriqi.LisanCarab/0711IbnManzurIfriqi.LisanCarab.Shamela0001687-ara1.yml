90#VERS#COMMENT##: The metadata refers to a third edition from 1993
    published by Dar al-Sadir. I cannot find this on worldcat. The permalink
    is to the 1st edition. I have collated with the 1st edition - pagination
    is the same. Occasionally subtitles are missing. Otherwise, very good
    digital edition.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Just the first-level headers were tagged. I tagged
    the second-level headers and all the entries. 2- Find other editions here:
