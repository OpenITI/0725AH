90#VERS#COMMENT##: The auto-tagging was not entirely succesful in this text,
        needed significant cleaning up. I have done so with regex, but the easiest
        way
        to do it resulted in not all names being confined to one line. A lot of them
        are
        still on two or more lines and sometimes spread over pages (as is the case
        in
        the edition), which perhaps needs to be addressed later on.
        I deleted editorial sections and footnote markers, tagged poetry (there were a
        handful of cases of overtagging, i.e. of non-poetry being tagged, which I
        have
        deleted, but some may remain). Pagination appears to be correct, though I
        had to
        change every PageV06 to PageV05 (volume 6 is made up of indices that are not
        part of the digital text). There are quite a few empty biographies, these
        are
        also empty in the edition.
        NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 3968, 4767,
        8426, 9721, 10707, 12308, 14354, 18164, 18310, 18371, 18808, 20047, 21332,
