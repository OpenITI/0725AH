90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: 
90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * Kraken version: 3.0.0.0b21.dev6
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: 12-24-2021_ArabPersGeneralized.mlmodel
    Annotated and corrected by Gowaart.
    OCR was largely successful but did skip some lines (or generated only nonsense
    for some lines),
    which I have corrected where I spotted it. Annotated according to textual logic
    as evident from a superficial look.
    Hierarchy is not self-evident from layout.
    I have given header status to most words and phrases rendered between brackets
    which clearly indicate new sections.
    Most sections separated by an asterisk I have rendered on new paragraphs to
    break the text into more manageable units.
